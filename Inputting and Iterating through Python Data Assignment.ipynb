    "# Exercise 1: Visualize a MNIST Character\n",
    "\n",
    "The MNIST data set is often used a people's first example in a neural networks course.  It is a database fo 60,000 handwritten images of numerical digits from 0 to 9.  Your Artificial Intelligence course will also take this tack. Here is a link to the origin of the MNIST dataset: [MNIST Origin Page](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). Here is a more convenient place to download the MNIST data in CSV format: [MNIST in CSV from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv/downloads/mnist-in-csv.zip/2/).  I have downloaded the data from the second source and made it available to you.  Its zip file includes two files <i>mnist_test.csv</i> and <i>mnist_train.csv</i>.  We will use the former file, which included 10,000 images. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each MNIST character is 28 $\\times$ 28 pixels, each of which are coded in grayscale as represented by a digit from 0 to 255.  The data for each image in <i>mnist_train.csv</i> is given as 784 characters ($28 \\times 28$) on a single line.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for one example MNIST character from the file <font face = 'courier'>ministEg.txt</font> is shown below as is the character it represents.  The original MNIST data have been converted into 28 lines of 28 data elements so that it can be more easily inputted into a 28 $\\times$ 28 array or list of lists and, subsequently, rendered by matplotlib.     \n",

    "## The Task\n",
    "Import the data from  <font face = 'courier'>ministEg.txt</font>, put it into a list of lists with numerical elements, and plot it with the <font face = 'courier'>matplotlib</font> package as was done in lecture with other images.  Specifically, render the image using the <font face = 'courier'>plt.imshow()</font> and <font face = 'courier'>plt.show()</font> commands as we did in class.  The argument <font face = 'courier'>cmap = 'gray'</font> communicates to <font face = 'courier'>matplotlib</font> that the data reflect a grayscale image.  The <font face = 'courier'>import</font> statement and the aforementioned commands are included in the cell below for convenience."
